## Security considerations for integrators

This bundle provides a form type and an API endpoint that returns the list of configured icon identifiers (no user data). It does not handle authentication or authorization. If you consider the icon list sensitive, ensure the icons API route is only accessible in appropriate environments (e.g. restrict by firewall or role). The API returns static configuration-derived data; ensure your application does not expose it to untrusted users if that would be a concern.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English or Spanish.
